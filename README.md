# xrpl.js

A JavaScript/TypeScript library for interacting with the XRP Ledger

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/xrpl.png)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/xrpl)
![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/min/xrpl)

This is the recommended library for integrating a JavaScript/TypeScript app with the XRP Ledger, especially if you intend to use advanced functionality such as IOUs, payment paths, the decentralized exchange, account settings, payment channels, escrows, multi-signing, and more.

## [➡️ Reference Documentation](http://js.xrpl.org)

See the full reference documentation for all classes, methods, and utilities.

### Features

+ Works in Node.js and in web browsers
+ Helpers for creating requests and parsing responses for the [XRP Ledger APIs](https://xrpl.org/rippled-api.html)
+ Listen to events on the XRP Ledger (transactions, ledger, validations, etc.)
+ Sign and submit transactions to the XRP Ledger
+ Type definitions for TypeScript

### Requirements

+ **[Node.js v14](https://nodejs.org/)** is recommended. We also support v12 and v16. Other versions may work but are not frequently tested.

## Getting Started

In an existing project (with `package.json`), install `xrpl.js`:

```
$ npm install --save xrpl
```

Or with `yarn`:

```
$ yarn add xrpl
```

Example usage:

```js
const xrpl = require("xrpl")
async function main() {
  const client = new xrpl.Client("wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233")
  await client.connect()

  const response = await client.request({
    "command": "account_info",
    "account": "rLSn6Z3T8uCxbcd1oxwfGQN1Fdn5CyGujK:61854392",
    "ledger_index": "validated"
  })
  console.log(response)

  client.disconnect()
}
main()
```

For more examples, see the [documentation](#documentation).

### Using xrpl.js with React Native

If you want to use `xrpl.js` with React Native you will need to install shims for core NodeJS modules. To help with this you can use a module like [rn-nodeify](https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify).

1. Install dependencies (you can use `yarn` as well):

    ```shell
    npm install react-native-crypto
    npm install xrpl
    # install peer deps
    npm install react-native-randombytes
    # install latest rn-nodeify
    npm install rn-nodeify@latest --dev
    ```

2. After that, run the following command:

    ```shell
    # install node core shims and recursively hack package.json files
    # in ./node_modules to add/update the "browser"/"react-native" field with relevant mappings
    ./node_modules/.bin/rn-nodeify --hack --install
    ```

3. Enable `crypto`:

    `rn-nodeify` will create a `shim.js` file in the project root directory.
    Open it and uncomment the line that requires the crypto module:

    ```javascript
    // If using the crypto shim, uncomment the following line to ensure
    // crypto is loaded first, so it can populate global.crypto
    require('crypto')
    ```

4. Import `shim` in your project (it must be the first line):

  ```javascript
  import './shim'
  ...
  ```

### Using xrpl.js with Deno

Until official support for [Deno](https://deno.land) is added, you can use the following work-around to use `xrpl.js` with Deno:

```javascript
import xrpl from 'https://dev.jspm.io/npm:xrpl';

(async () => {
  const api = new (xrpl as any).Client('wss://s.altnet.rippletest.net:51233');
  const address = 'rH8NxV12EuV...khfJ5uw9kT';

  api.connect().then(() => {
    api.getBalances(address).then((balances: any) => {
      console.log(JSON.stringify(balances, null, 2));
    });
  });
})();
```
